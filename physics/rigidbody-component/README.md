# Rigidbody Component

The Rigidbody component tells the program to see the object that it's attached to has mass. It adds gravity, drag, constraints, and determines how other objects interact with it. This guide will get you started, but will not go in-depth, so please check out the [Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RigidbodiesOverview.html) for more information.
