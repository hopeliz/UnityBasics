# Physics Basics

This section will cover the basics of some of the physics to get you started. Please check out the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PhysicsSection.html) for more information.

Physics generally refer to how game objects interact with each other. When they touch or overlap, they can trigger other events and can be set to go through \(clip through\) each other or treat each other as solid objects.
