# Deleting and Disabling Objects in the Editor

### Deleting Game Objects

Game objects can be deleted easily within the Unity editor.

Just select your game object in the [Hierarchy Tab](../../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/hierarchy-tab.md) or [Scene Tab](../../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/scene-tab.md) and press the Delete key on your keyboard.

Another way is to select your game object in the Hierarchy Tab, right-click within the tab, and select **Delete**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you delete a parent object, the child objects will also be deleted. Read more about [Parenting](../../create/create-game-objects/parenting/).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Changes and additions made while in Play Mode will revert back to the values before playing.
{% endhint %}

### Disabling Game Objects

Sometimes, you just want to disable a game object to use later or to test a scene without it. [Hiding objects in the Scene view](../../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/hierarchy-tab.md#hiding-objects) only hides it in this that tab.

To disable and enable objects, select the object in the Hierarchy Tab or Scene Tab.

In the Inspector Tab, click the checkbox next to the name of the game object to toggle its availability.

A shortcut for this is **ALT + SHIFT + A**
