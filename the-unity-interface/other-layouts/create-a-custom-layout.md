# Create a Custom Layout

To create a custom layout, **click and drag** tabs around the screen.

They will snap to edges or appear in the same space as another tab.

Click and drag on the borders between tab windows to resize them.

## Finding a Tab / Window

Don't see a needed tab?

Find it under Window in the taskbar and open it. It will appear as a tab to be moved and resized.

## **Saving a Layout**

Use the Layout dropdown at the top right of the screen. It will show "Layout" or the name of the last selected layout.
