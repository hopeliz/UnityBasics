# Game Window

## Default View

This window shows what the player sees through one of the cameras in the scene.

![Example of the Game View of a scene with a single sphere game object added.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (51).png>)

The Game window will default to the view from the last camera added to the scene. For new scenes, this will be the Main Camera.

Objects and assets cannot be added, updated, or deleted in this window. It is to show you the result of your actions in other tabs and what the player will ultimately see.
