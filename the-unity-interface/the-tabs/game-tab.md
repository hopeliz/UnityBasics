# Game Tab

This tab shows what the player sees through one of the cameras in the scene.

The Game Scene will default to the view from the last camera added to the scene. For new scenes, this will be the Main Camera.

Objects and views cannot be added, updated, or deleted in this tab for it is to show you the result of your actions in other tabs and what the player will ultimately see.
