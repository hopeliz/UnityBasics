# Intro to Transforms

Every game object in your scene will have a **Transform **component that shows the position coordinates as well as the object's rotation and size (scale).

Each of these properties is a Vector3 type that takes three floating point numbers as x, y, and z coordinates. For 2D games, only x and y are used and z remains at zero.

Please see the following sections for more information:

{% content-ref url="translate/" %}
[translate](translate/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="rotate/" %}
[rotate](rotate/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="scale/" %}
[scale](scale/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
