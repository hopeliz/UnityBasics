# Intro to Transforms

Every game object in your scene will have a **Transform** component that shows the position coordinates as well as the object's rotation and size \(scale\).

Each of these properties is a Vector3 type that takes three floating point numbers as x, y, and z coordinates. For 2D games, only x and y are used and z remains at zero.

Please see the following sections for more information:
