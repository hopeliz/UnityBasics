# Translate

## Translation

Translation is another term for movement from one position to another. Generally, the coordinates shown in the Transform component are the center of the object unless otherwise specified by the developer. The object's global position is based on a coordinate system for the game, but when an object is placed in another ([parenting](../../create/create-game-objects/parenting.md)), the coordinates are the position within its parent object.

You can...

[Move an object within the Unity editor](positioning.md)

[Move an object during gameplay using Transform.Translate()](using-translate.md)

[Move an object during gameplay by directly updating its position](updating-position.md)
