# Creating Game Objects

**Game objects** are the objects in the actual game and they appear in the [Hierarchy](../../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/hierarchy-tab.md). They are comprised of a series of [components](../create-scripts/) that determine how the objects appear, move, and react to physics within the scene.

Some examples of game objects include [3D primitives](3d-primitives.md), cameras, lights, and particle systems.

Each game object has a Transform component that controls its [position, rotation, and size](../../translate-rotate-and-scale/intro-to-transforms.md).

You can...

[Create game objects using the Unity editor](editor-creating-game-objects.md)

[Create game objects during gameplay using a script](spawning-objects.md)

[Unhide hidden objects to make them appear](unhiding-objects.md)
