# Creating Game Objects

Game objects are the objects in the actual game and they appear in the [Hierarchy Tab](../../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/hierarchy-tab.md).

You can...

[Create game objects in the Unity Editor](editor-creating-game-objects.md)

[Create game objects in a scene using commands within a C\# script](spawning-objects.md)

[Unhide hidden objects to make them appear](unhiding-objects.md)
