## Adding a Built-In Component

When you select a game object or asset, you will see the **Add Component** button at the end of the components in the [Inspector](../../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/inspector-tab.md):

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (83).png>)

Click this to open up a list of components and a search field.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (84).png>)

It starts with categories. Once you click on a category such as Physics, it will show you subcategories and components.

The search field is powerful, showing components matching your search term as you type it in.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (89).png>)

The search is remembered and appears the next time you click Add Component.

Click on the component and it will be added to your game object or asset, appearing in the Inspector window at the bottom, above the Add Component button (and Material, if it exists).

### **Copying**

You can right-click on any component and click Copy Component.

### **Pasting**

To paste a full component right-click in the Inspector Tab and click Paste Component As New.

If you are copying values from one object or asset to update another, click Paste Component Values instead.

**Reset** will return all values to a built-in default value.
