# Search and Focus

### **Search Fields Everywhere!**

Most tabs will have a search field at the top.

As you start to type, matching game objects, assets, components, labels, etc. will appear depending on the tab you are searching in.

| Tab | What it searches |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hierachy Tab | Game objects within the scene |
| Project Tab | Assets within a project |
| Inspector Tab's  Add Component button | Components and Scripts |
| Scene Tab | Visible game objects |
| Asset Store Tab | Items in the Asset Store |

### **Focus**

Sometimes, you select a game object in the Hierarchy tab, but it's off screen in the Scene Tab or maybe you selected a game object in the Scene Tab, but lost were it was located in a Hierarchy Tab.

Just press **F** to "focus"  or bring close / highlight the location of the selected game object. Press F while hovering over the tab you need the focus in.

### Finding Assets

The three dots on the top right of the [Hierarchy Tab](../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/hierarchy-tab.md) can find and highlight the current scene in the Project Tab.

Double clicking on a message, warning, or error in the [Console Tab](../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/console-tab.md) will find and highlight the script giving the message and sometimes the related game object.
