# Search and Focus

## **Search Fields Everywhere!**

Most windows will have a search field at the top.

As you start to type, matching game objects, assets, components, labels, etc. will appear depending on the window you are searching in.

| Window | What it searches |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hierarchy | Game objects within the scene |
| Project | Assets within a project |
| Inspector: Add Component button | Components and Scripts |
| Scene | Visible game objects |
| Asset Store | Items in the Asset Store |

## **Focus**

Sometimes, you select a game object in the Hierarchy, but it's off-screen in the Scene view or maybe you selected a game object in the Scene view, you but lost where it was located in the Hierarchy window.

Just press **F** to "focus" or bring close/highlight the location of the selected game object while hovering over the window you need the focus in.

## Finding Assets

The three dots on the top right of the [Hierarchy](../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/hierarchy-tab.md) window can find and highlight the current scene in the Project window.

Double-clicking on a message, warning, or error in the [Console](../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/console-tab.md) will find and highlight the script giving the message and sometimes the related game object.
