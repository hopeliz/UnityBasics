# Updating Assets

To update an Asset, select it in the [Project Tab](../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/project-tab.md).

### Renaming

Renaming assets can only be done in the Project Tab or within your computer's file management software.

Click once on the name to make it editable.

Once updated, press Enter or click off of the asset.

### Organizing

Assets can be moved from folder to folder by clicking and dragging selected assets into folders listed on the left.

### Updating Properties

Select an asset to see it's properties in the [Inspector Tab](../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/inspector-tab.md).

For most audio and visual assets, its properties are editable right in this tab. Values can be updated through typing in values, selecting a color from a color wheel, clicking on the circle/target icon and selecting assets, or clicking and dragging assets into the fields.

Some assets, such as Animators, are updated in their own tab. Please see the Unity documentation for more information.

### Updating Scripts

There are three ways to open a script:

1. Double-click the script asset in the Project Tab.
2. Select the script in the Project Tab and click **Open...** in the Inspector Tab.
3. In the Inspector Tab, right-click on the script that is attached to a game object and click Edit Script.

This will open the script in your IDE/code editor \(usually Visual Studio or MonoDevelop\).
