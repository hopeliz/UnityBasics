# Updating Assets

To update an Asset, select it in the [Project ](../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/project-tab.md)window.

## Renaming

Renaming assets can only be done in the Project window or within your computer's file management software.

Click once on the name to make it editable.

Once updated, press the Enter/Return key or click off of the asset.

## Organizing

Assets can be moved from folder to folder by clicking and dragging selected assets into folders listed on the left.

## Updating Properties

Select an asset to see it's properties in the [Inspector](../the-unity-interface/the-tabs/inspector-tab.md).

For most audio and visual assets, its properties are editable right in this window. Values can be updated through typing in values, selecting a color from a color wheel, clicking on the circle/target icon and selecting assets, or clicking and dragging assets into the fields.

Some assets, such as Animators, are updated in their own tab. Please see the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) for more information.

## Updating Scripts

There are three ways to open a script:

1. Double-click the script asset in the Project window.
2. Select the script in the Project window and click **Open...** in the Inspector.
3. In the Inspector, right-click on the script that is attached to a game object and click Edit Script.
