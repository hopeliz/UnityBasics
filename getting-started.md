# Getting Started with Unity Software

**Download and install Unity Hub**\
Unity is a game engine that you can download for free as a student and for personal use [here](https://store.unity.com/?\_ga=2.219619545.1982751462.1590796351-1267817405.1590796351#plans-individual).

**Make an account**\
You will need to make an account with Unity.com. This helps when multiple people use the same computer, syncing with GitHub, and when you want to access your favorite items in the Asset Store.

**Install the latest version of the Unity software**\
****Open Unity Hub and click on Installs.

This is where you can download and install the latest version of Unity. Click the "Add" button to do this. You can also access previously installed versions to avoid breaking older projects.

**Create a new unity project**\
Go to Projects and click on the new button. The Projects section also provides a list of past projects for quick access and reference.

Here, you can give your project a name, tell the program the location to save, and decide what kind of project it will be. Choosing 2D or 3D will not prevent you from changing your mind later.

When you are ready, click the "Create" button and wait.

It takes a while for a new project to load, but when it does, it will be empty and will show the interface last used. Usually, this is the [Default Interface](the-unity-interface/the-default-interface.md).
